86 (of 86) markers to be included from [ CEU17.map ]
Warning, found 85 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ CEU17.nosex ]
85 individuals read from [ CEU17.ped ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 85 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 85 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 86 SNPs
85 founders and 0 non-founders found
1 markers to be excluded based on HWE test ( p <= 0.001 )
	0 markers failed HWE test in cases
	0 markers failed HWE test in controls
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 0.99 )
73 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0.05 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 12 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 85 missing
After filtering, 0 males, 0 females, and 85 of unspecified sex
